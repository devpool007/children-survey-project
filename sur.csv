18,South Africa,Male,No,0,"Too much pooping. Like damn i dont know what is in that babymilk formula but those guys can seriously take a dump. Could honestly have been more lethal to drop a dump truck of baby poop onto Hiroshima than the bomb. Besides the nuclear waste deposits that children generate they are also very loud screamy bois. Not even just when they are young, like seriously those guys just get louder and more drunk as they get older. Thirdly its probably just cheaper to have like three sugar babies than one real baby, and then you also have the added boon of recieving head for your money instead of a headache because your daughter beat a girl at school and didnt get the horse she wanted for christmas because she was on santa's naughty list. And finally ive already got 3 club penguin puffles, a rock named Michael AND several floating biofilm producing bacterial cultures to take care of so a baby would just be overkill, he'd probably chow down on my biofilm bacteria thinking they were pancakes. But hey thats just a theory, a baby theory, thanks for reading."
